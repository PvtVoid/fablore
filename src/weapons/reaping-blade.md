An omen of death, forged in the darkest shadows, blade sharpened on the spirits of the damned. The product of a fiendish ritual, the wicked sword inevitably corrupts all that it touches. Its victims are caught in a constant state of torment, their wounds bleeding and bleeding without end. Even as they collapse to the ground, weakened by the blade's heinous curse, the blade never falters, ever hungry, draining every last drop of blood.
